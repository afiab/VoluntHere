    <p>Volunteering is a great way to help your community</p>
    <p>In the search tab, you can look for volunteer opportunities.
      In the Post tab, you can add a volunteer opportunity for others 
      to find. The leaderboard displays the people who gave back the most
      hours to their communities. In news, you can learn about current 
      situtations that may need more attention.
    </p>

    <p>Over 4.5 trillion people in over 40 trillion cities
      have been positively impacted by our volunteering opportunities. 
      Be a part of the change you want to see.
